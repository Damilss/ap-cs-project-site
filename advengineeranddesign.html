    <h2>Fusion Tutorial Parts</h2>
    <p><a href="https://gmail4336485.autodesk360.com/g/projects/20240816791855281/data/dXJuOmFkc2sud2lwcHJvZDpmcy5mb2xkZXI6Y28uaEdCblFRR1RRRmFLSnNaVE04aEE5Zw">Fusion tutorial parts</a></p>
    <p>Fusion tutorial parts was a beginner introduction of the use of fusion360. Fusion360 is a comercial computer-aided design (CAD) programmed created by the software corporation Autodesk. It also can be used as a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), or a Printed circuit board (PCB) design application. The assignment was to create and model random componenets and parts that look like they would go on something else. This program was more difficult for me to understand and use as it was more complex and sophisticated. Learning how to start from scratch on different pieces was a struggle for me, especially since I have never used fusion 360. one of the most helpful pieces of information was that when starting on a specific compenent to build, if you do not start the right way, you could end up messing yourself up for the rest of the project. Continuing to learn the ins and outs of this software year long will be a journey, but overall Fusion360 is a wonderful software application and could be very useful in the future. Some individuals in my class have more experience than me so getting help will be really easy to do.   </p>
