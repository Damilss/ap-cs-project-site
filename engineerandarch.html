      <h2>Lego house build</h2>
      <p>The Lego house build was one of our first assignments done in our enginering and architecture class. The assignment was to create a lego house using a specified amount of blocks in. There were no parameters or regulations as to how the house had to be build, it just had to have the intent of being a house. My house here is a pool house on wheels. There is a pool on top of the house with the main living area in the middle. Then the bottom part has wheels to be able to take the house wherever.  </p>

      <p> The Cedreo house assignment was one of most unique and interesting assignments I have ever done in school. The Cedreo house assignment was to design a house to our specified desire. The only requirement was that the house was not to exceed 1000 sq. ft.. The program cedreo is a 3D house design software that allows users to create 3D models and 3D renderings of whatever they create. The program was fairly easy to use with very little difficulty managing the UI. Belwo are two images of the hosue I created. I highly reccoment the program to anybody interested in designing their own house for fun, or even for professional use.   </p>

      <h2>Roof Styles</h2>
       <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IDprQTsRBhFVx_ipQbs8WC7_rJh-ryNC/view?usp=drive_link" >Roof Styles</a></p>
      <p> In our roof styles assignment, we took our real world  root architectual styles and learned how to make them in sketchup. A lot of the roof styles included creating a 2D design of each roof and using the push pull technique  to turn it into a 3d Shape. Other instances involved outlining the type of roof using the line tool and creating the roof by connecting the lines together so that it would fit in. This assignment was more experience in how the line, offset, and push/pull toosl come together to be able to create many shapes. My project includes 8 kinds of roofs. Cross Gable, Front Gable, Gambrel, Hipped, Mansard, Pavilion Hipped, Saltbox, and side gabled. Below I included the presnation of each style of roof in Sketchup in a youtube video.  </p>
