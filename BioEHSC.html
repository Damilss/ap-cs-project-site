      Polymer Process
      </h2>
       <p>One third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted each year. The disposal of food waste to landfills is not sustainable as it leads to rapid depletion. Almost 60% of banana biomass is left as waste. Worldwide, about 114.08 million metric tons of banana waste-loss are produced.</p>

       <h2>Main Steps</h2>
       <ul>
         <li class="BioList">Lactic Acid Fermentation</li>
         <li class="BioList">Lactic Acid Polymerization</li>
         <li class="BioList">Poly(Lactic) Acid Melt Spinning (Irrelevant)</li>
       </ul>

       <hr>

       <h3><strong>Lactic Acid Fermentation</strong></h3>
       <p>Food waste is used as feedstock for fermentation. Two specific fungi are added to the food waste in order to ferment it:</p>
       <ul>
         <li><em class="BioList">Aspergillus awamori</em></li>
         <li><em class="BioList">Aspergillus oryzae</em></li>
       </ul>

       <p>Enzymes are actively secreted in situ by these two specific fungi through <em>solid state fermentation</em>. Enzyme-rich fungal mashes are thoroughly blended with the food waste and undergo <em>hydrolysis</em> in a <em>bioreactor</em>, producing a nutrient-rich fermentation feedstock.</p>

       <p>Bacteria consume the nutrients in the feedstock, producing <strong>lactic acid</strong>. To recover this lactic acid, cell biomass and colored impurities must be removed. The fermentation broth is filtered and centrifuged. Color impurities are absorbed by activated carbon, and the solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (60 °C for two hours). The solution is then continuously extracted using <em>ethyl acetate</em> via <em>sonication</em>, separated with a <em>separatory funnel</em>, and finally, the <strong>lactic acid</strong> is isolated by distillation at 40 °C for 30 minutes.</p>

       <hr>

       <h3><strong>Lactic Acid Polymerization</strong></h3>
       <p>The recovered <strong>lactic acid</strong> is polymerized into PLA through <em>ring-opening polymerization</em>. The process uses a novel catalytic method with zinc oxide nanoparticle dispersion as the catalyst in <em>lactide synthesis</em>.</p>

       <p>The lactide is synthesized through dehydration, oligomerization, and depolymerization. It is then purified by recrystallization in ethyl acetate at 4 °C for 24 hours. The precipitate is separated by vacuum filtration and dried in a vacuum oven (40 °C, 100 Pa, 24 hours).</p>

       <p>PLA is then synthesized by heating the lactide at 200 °C under nitrogen. The final purification step involves precipitation in cold methanol, followed by vacuum filtration and drying. This produces high-purity PLA with relatively high molecular weight.</p>

       <hr>

       <h3><em>Poly(Lactic) Acid Melt Spinning (Irrelevant)</em></h3>
       <p>Poly(lactic) acid melt spinning is a technique used in the textile industry to create fibers or yarns from PLA. This was not a focus of our research.</p>

        Lego house build
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Lego house build was one of our first assignments done in our enginering and architecture class. The assignment was to create a lego house using a specified amount of blocks in. There were no parameters or regulations as to how the house had to be build, it just had to have the intent of being a house. My house here is a pool house on wheels. There is a pool on top of the house with the main living area in the middle. Then the bottom part has wheels to be able to take the house wherever.
